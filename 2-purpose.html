    <span>The purpose</span> <span>which guided him</span> <span>was not impossible,</span> <span>though</span> <span>supernatural.</span> 
    <span>He wanted to</span> <a href="3-discovery.html" style="color: white;">dream a man</a> <span>; he</span> <span>wanted to</span> <span>dream him</span> <span>in minute</span> <span>entirety</span> <span>and impose</span> <span>him on reality.</span>
    <div class="effect">This magic project had exhausted the entire expanse of his mind; if someone had asked him his name or to relate some event of his former life, he would not have been able to give an answer.</div>
    <span>This uninhabited,</span> <span>ruined temple</span> <span>suited him,</span> <span>for it is</span>
    <span>contained</span> <span>a minimum</span> <span>of visible</span> <span>world;</span> <span>the proximity</span> 
    <span>of the workmen</span> <span>also suited him,</span> <span>for they</span> <span>took it upon</span> 
    <span>themselves</span> <span>to provide</span> <span>for his</span> <span>frugal needs.</span> 
    <span>The rice</span> <span>and fruit</span> <span>they brought him</span> <span>were</span> <span>nourishment enough</span> 
    <span>for his body,</span> <span>which was</span> <span>consecrated to</span> <span>the sole task</span> 
    <span>of sleeping</span> <span>and dreaming.</span>
